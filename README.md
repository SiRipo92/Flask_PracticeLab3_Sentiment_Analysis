# Practice Project: AI-Based Web Application Development and Deployment

## Overview

This practice project demonstrates the creation of a sentiment analysis application using Watson AI libraries, designed to analyze the sentiment of a given text. The application is deployed over the web using the Flask framework. This project helped in gaining hands-on experience integrating AI functionalities into a web app and deploying it, preparing for more complex projects.

## Tasks and Objectives

The project includes the following tasks:

1. **Clone the Project Repository**  
   The repository was cloned to obtain the necessary project files and set up the development environment.

2. **Create a Sentiment Analysis Application**  
   The Watson NLP library was utilized to build an application capable of analyzing the sentiment of provided text.

3. **Format the Output**  
   The sentiment analysis results were formatted to present them in a user-friendly manner.

4. **Package the Application**  
   The application files were organized into a modular format to enhance maintainability and usability.

5. **Run Unit Tests**  
   Unit tests were written and executed to ensure the application functions as expected and the sentiment analysis produces correct results for various inputs.

6. **Deploy the Application Using Flask**  
   Flask was used to deploy the sentiment analysis application on the web, making it accessible through a browser.

7. **Incorporate Error Handling**  
   Error handling was added to manage edge cases, such as invalid input or API failures, ensuring the app handles such situations gracefully.

8. **Run Static Code Analysis**  
   Static code analysis was performed to assess code quality, readability, and adherence to best practices, including PEP8 guidelines.

## Project Guidelines

This project provided hands-on experience in creating an AI-powered web application and deploying it using Flask. While there was no formal scoring, completing this project helped prepare for the final project.

By completing this project, the following milestones were achieved:

- Created an AI-based sentiment analysis application using Watson NLP embedded libraries.
- Formatted the output of the sentiment analysis results to extract meaningful insights.
- Organized the application into a modular structure for easy reuse.
- Wrote and executed unit tests to validate the accuracy of the sentiment analysis results.
- Deployed the application using the Flask framework for web accessibility.
- Incorporated error handling to ensure the app responds appropriately to failures.
- Conducted static code analysis to ensure code quality and compliance with PEP8 standards.
